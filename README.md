# physics_101

Python
This repository is dedicated to solving physics problems using Python programming language. Here you can find a range of scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how complex physics problems can be solved through the power of computational methods.

Contents
The repository is organized by physical topics, including but not limited to:

Classical Mechanics
Electromagnetism
Quantum Mechanics
Thermodynamics
Statistical Mechanics
Relativity
Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. We recommend Python 3.8 or later. Additionally, some scripts may require third-party Python libraries, such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

Usage
Clone the repository using the following command:


Copy code

```
git clone https://github.com/seregatipich/physics_101.git
```

Navigate into the directory of the topic you're interested in and run the Python script
